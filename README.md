# Dead Habit

i always get distracted watching horse and cat reels. yes you could say addicted.  
and i forget i literally have a horse in the house to take care of.

so my stupid hard-to-persuade mind decided:  

**“don’t use a prebuilt extension, no no, life is not that easy boy.”**  
let's waste more time and build our extensyion

this extension blocks sites that suck your time and soul, like 4chan, youtube, instagram, reddit... you name it.  
so if you keep opening these without thinking, this is for you.

built for Chrome, firefox coming soon

> if you feel like you're addicted to dumb sites and wasting time, this one is for you.
